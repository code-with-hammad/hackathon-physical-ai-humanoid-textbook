# Physics in Gazebo (Gravity and Collisions)

This chapter will delve into the fundamental physics simulations within Gazebo, focusing specifically on how gravity and collisions are modeled and configured. Understanding these concepts is crucial for creating realistic and interactive digital twin environments.

## Gravity

Gazebo provides robust support for simulating gravitational forces. We will explore:
- How to define and modify gravity in a Gazebo world file.
- The impact of gravity on various simulated entities, such as robots and objects.
- Examples of configuring different gravitational settings for diverse simulation scenarios.

## Collisions

Accurate collision detection and response are vital for robotic simulations. This section will cover:
- The principles of collision geometries and their importance in Gazebo.
- How to define collision shapes for robot links and static objects in SDF (Simulation Description Format).
- The distinction between visual and collision models.
- Practical examples of configuring collision properties, such as friction and restitution.

## Practical Exercises

- Launching a basic Gazebo world with gravitational effects.
- Spawning objects and observing their behavior under gravity.
- Designing and simulating collision scenarios between different robot parts and environment elements.
- Troubleshooting common issues related to physics configurations.
