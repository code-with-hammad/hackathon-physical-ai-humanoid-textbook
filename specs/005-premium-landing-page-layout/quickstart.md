# Quickstart: Premium Landing Page

This guide explains how to set up and run the development environment to view the new premium landing page.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version >= 20.0, as specified in `package.json`)
- npm (or your preferred package manager like yarn, pnpm)

## Setup

1.  **Install Dependencies**: If you haven't already, install the project's dependencies from the root of the repository:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Development Server

1.  **Start Docusaurus**: Run the following command from the root of the repository to start the local development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

2.  **View the Landing Page**: The development server will automatically open a new browser tab. If it doesn't, navigate to the URL shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

    The new premium landing page will be the first page you see. Any changes you make to the source code (e.g., in `src/components/PremiumLandingPage/`) will be automatically reloaded in the browser.
